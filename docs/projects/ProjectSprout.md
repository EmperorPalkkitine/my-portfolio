# Project Sprout

**Software:** Arduino Coding, AutoCAD  
**Role:** Lead Developer for Mobile Energy Robot (PETE)
**Dates:** 2021

## Summary
One of the biggest challenges facing our global society today is the ever-increasing need
for food and the immense strain, it puts on the agricultural industry. Project Sprout is an attempt
at developing a solution to help farmers grow their crops and disperse labor more efficiently.
There are a few problems that farmers and growers face today that automation can help solve.
Project Sprout aims to aid food production through a drone swarm that will help with watering,
plant and soil nutrition, pest and animal deterrent, soil temperature regulation, and frost
management. Throughout this design process, third-party stakeholders have been excluded to
ensure the design is made solely by engineers for growers.

## Key Features
- 4 individual robots that interact and work together as a drone swarm
- PETE offers a mobile charging platform for the other drones in the swarm
- Designed to be affordable and repairable by the end-user (no proprietary hardware or software)

## Technical Notes
- Restricted to a budget of $1000 per drone and a weight limit of 400lbs per drone.
- Deployable folding solar panels utilized on a telescopic pole to reach above crops.
- Coded on Arduino utilizing multiple inputs and outputs for total autonomy.

## What I learned
- Basics of coding of both AutoCAD and Arduino coding 
- Collaboration with teammates was a must and was done all online
- Project scope and management including design requirements was a heavily emphasized
